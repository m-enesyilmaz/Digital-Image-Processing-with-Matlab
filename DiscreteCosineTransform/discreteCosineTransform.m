% The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) expresses a finite set of data points 
% as a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. DCT is a 
% conversion technique widely used in signal processing and data compression. 
% DCTs are important for many other applications in science and engineering, 
% such as digital signal processing, telecommunications equipment, reducing 
% network bandwidth usage, and spectral methods for the numerical solution 
% of partial differential equations. 

% Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) perform 
% similar functions; both split a finite-length discrete time vector into 
% the sum of scaled and shifted basis functions. The difference between 
% the two is the type of base function used by each conversion. DFT uses a 
% set of complex exponential functions that are harmonically related, while 
% DCT uses only (real-valued) cosine functions.

% Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a lossy compression method.

% Since DCT is orthogonal, the inverse kernel is equal to the forward kernel. 
% It is more traceable than Fourier because the values move in a zig-zag pattern.
