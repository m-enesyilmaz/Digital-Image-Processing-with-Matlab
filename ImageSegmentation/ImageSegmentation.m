% The purpose of segmentation is to simplify and/or transform the representation of 
% an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation 
% is often used to find objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. 
% In general, segmentation algorithms for grayscale images are designed based on 
% one of two basic properties of gray level values. These features are related to 
% discontinuity and similarity in gray level values in the image. 

% we plot the images, we read

% Edge detection is one of the fundamental issues in image processing. 
% The edge in an image corresponds to a significant change in the physical 
% appearance of an image, such as illumination or surface reflections, which 
% manifests itself in brightness, color, and texture.

% Active contour is one of the segmentation techniques that uses energy 
% constraints and forces in the image to separate the region of interest from 
% the image. This method defines a separate boundary or curvature for 
% the regions of the target object to be used in segmentation. Contours are 
% boundaries designed for desired relevant areas in an image and are the sum of 
% the points that have undergone the interpolation process. The interpolation 
% operation can be linear, curved, and polynomial, which defines the curve 
% in the image. Different active contour models are applied in image processing. 
% These define the smooth shape for the image and create a closed border for 
% the region. The curvature of the contour models is determined using various 
% algorithms using external and internal forces applied. External energy is 
% defined as the combination of internal energy used to control the formal 
% changes of the borders surrounding the image and image-induced forces 
% used to control the position of the borders on the image. The desired 
% contour is achieved by using the minimum of functional energy.

% We create a mask in the frame we have determined;
mask1 = zeros(size(img2,1), size(img2,2));
mask1(120:end-150,75:end-85) = 1; % we give the values according to our image
% BW = activecontour(A,mask,n) segments the image, enhancing the contour for a maximum of n iterations.
snake1 = activecontour(img2, mask1, 200);
% We apply the segmented image to its own image;
bn1 = uint8(snake1.*double(img2));

% We create a mask in the frame we have determined;
mask2 = zeros(size(img3,1), size(img3,2));

% Advantages of contours;
% In search of minimum energy; autonomous and self-adaptive.
% Ability to follow moving objects in both temporal (timewise) and spatial directions.
% Specific energies can be identified to enhance contour development.
% Limitations of contours;
% It can get stuck at local minimum points.
% In the process of minimizing the entire contour energy, the smallest features can be overlooked.
% May require higher computation time.
