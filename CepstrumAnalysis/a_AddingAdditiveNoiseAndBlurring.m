% Spatial Filtering:
% For spatial filtering, the image to be filtered is processed with a subimage. 
% The sub-image is placed over the original image and is hovered over the image 
% step by step. The associated pixels of the original image and sub-image 
% (filter or mask) are processed.
% Convolution Matrix
% Convolution is the process of scanning the whole picture on a square picture, 
% starting from the upper left corner of a square mask and passing the center of 
% the mask over each pixel.

% We choose random noise and apply it in a way that makes additive noise and blurring.

% If we create the noise ourselves:
% If we want to create white noise;

% If we create and add the image with the Matlab command;
% J = imnoise(I,'gaussian',m,var_gauss); with m mean, var_gauss variance
% We add noise with a gaussian distribution.
