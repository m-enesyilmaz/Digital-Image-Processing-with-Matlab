% Cepstrum analysis is a non-linear signal processing technique with various 
% applications in fields such as speech and image processing. The Cepstrum 
% of the complex x of a sequence is calculated by finding the complex natural 
% logarithm of the Fourier transform of x, then the inverse Fourier transform 
% of the resulting sequence.
% When we do a Cepstrum analysis, we get a different domain. There is neither 
% a frequency domain nor a spatial domain. The reason for this is that 
% the logarithm is taken when performing the Cepstrum analysis. It also 
% overcomes the instability in IIR as the Fourier transform is used. 
% We cannot see the signal as we see it in the spatial domain, it looks like it.

% As a disadvantage, the phase function should be in the range of ¬±2ùúã due to taking 
% the logarithm, but in some regions the phase is cut off and may seem stuck. 
% Phase correction should be done (Phase unwrapping). Despite this disadvantage, 
% it is widely used in image restoration because it overcomes the instability 
% in IIR and is logarithmic addition.

% We will bring the blurred image to the cepstrum region and reduce the effect 
% of noise from the image in the cepstrum region with the filter we will design 
% in the cepstrum region, then we will observe it in the spatial region.
