% In logarithm operation, large dynamic range of values gets compressed into a smaller 
% range especially when values get bigger and so naturally scaling this compressed 
% range to [0,1] will give us better visual results.
% The reason we add 1 to each component and then get the LOG is to avoid the log(0) 
% operation. If any magnitude component is zero, it will evaluate to log(1), 
% which will be 0. Once we've done that, we can rescale the screen using 
% the imshow(..., []) command so that the smallest magnitude component goes to 0 
% while the largest magnitude component goes to 1 of the LOG spectrum. 
% Note that the original spectrum has not been altered so we can do our operations on it.
