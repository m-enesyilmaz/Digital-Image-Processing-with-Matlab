% Here is our problem:
% The details of the image lost as a result of blurring; revealing the details 
% by passing through image enrichment filters and returning them to 
% the closest form to the original.

% we convert the color image to gray level;
[rows, columns, numberOfColorChannels] = size(img);
% if the image is in color change it to gray:
if numberOfColorChannels > 1
    imgGray = rgb2gray(img);

% The Laplacian filter is used to sharpen and define boundaries in the image. 
% It is based on second-order derivatives. Laplacian filter application 
% is made by taking the 2nd degree derivative. The process of applying 
% the Laplacian filter is to take the convolutions of the input image and 
% the laplacian mask. The resulting image is called a filtered image.

laplacianKernel1 = [0,-1,0;-1,4,-1;0,-1,0];

% Humans are extremely sensitive to the edges and fine details of an image. 
% This is because edges and fine details are created by high-frequency components. 
% If we attenuate or remove the high-frequency components in the image, 
% the visual quality of our image will decrease accordingly. But if we consider 
% the reverse process, that is, if we improve the high-frequency components 
% in the image, this will lead to an improvement in visual quality. 
% Image sharpening refers to any enhancement technique that emphasizes and 
% enhances edges and fine details in an image.

% The Sobel operator is used for edge detection applications. Identifies 
% discontinuities on the image. It is done by taking the first-order derivative 
% in mathematics to identify discontinuities and sudden changes. Gradient 
% concept is also used instead of first-degree derivative.
